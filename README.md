# Escape - 2023

Escape is a simple game coded using 1.8 Java. It was originally developed as apart of the 2023 computer science final project. First game developed by Mason Z. computer science class | original created circa 2023

Originally intended as a final project for computer science, it features a basic understanding of java

* Note: As of now, I do have plans/ideas for the game, but I'm not entirely confident if it will be implemented - i.e this game may not continue in updates 

## Concept
The idea for this game was that we as the player, play as a character who was captured for unknown reasons and now is stuck in a mysterious prison. As the game progresses, we navigate the prison, hoping to escape. There will be traps, enemies, maps, and obstacles, and it is imperitive that you as the player to navigate throught the expanse, otherwise you will get DELETED, and RESETTED. 

## Controls 
WASD for movement, other controls will be on the screen as the game progresses

## Future Goals
* Complete revamp of code, simplify and use more advanced code (this was originally coded with a very basic understanding of java)
* Expand upon map, different levels
* Customization on difficulty
* Add enemey and friendly NPC's with interactions
* Add guns and weapons
* Make conversations one time when interacting and choose between different conversation choices
* Animations & Effects
* Expand upon character -> Change red dot to 2D 64 bit animation
* Add a main screen, ability to choose different maps, pause game, etc
* Polish graphics
* Make into a runnable application

## Current Edition
The current edition is split between the graphics and the text-adventure, both based on the same idea.
There are two versions of the text-adventures with minor changes, which is played without graphics through the console. 
The graphics version is a simple one floor map that is not complete, simply a proof of concept when this was implemented, very basic code. 

Most likely the entire game will be revamped if it is to continue, but the game concept will remain the same and simple. 

If you wish to run the graphics version, please run GraphicsMain.java
If you wish to run the console version, please run either TextAdventure.java or TextAdventureTwoPointO.java

## Requirements & Instructions
* Any computer installed with a program to run java code (version 1.8) - was tested on Mac M1 Eclipse

Download the latest release from java, then create a project in eclipse (or whatever program), use 1.8 java, then drag in the downloaded files into the SRC folder
